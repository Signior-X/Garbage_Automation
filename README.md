# Garbage_Automation
Automation system for garbage collection.

Aim:
I plan to create a automation system which can help to manage the garbage that is collected in places like parties, hostels, shops, etc.
In this, we will setup the ultrasonic sensors just above the dustbins so that as soon as the dustbin gets full, it automatically detects it and sends a notification on the user's mobile.
It can help when multiple dustbins are presents and in crowdy places to help the organisers to clean the bins as soon as it gets filled effectively.

Components used:
1. NodeMCU(ESP8266)
2. Ultrasonic sensors
3. Breadboard and some jumper wires
4. A smartphone
