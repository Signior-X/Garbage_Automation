Material Required:
1. NodeMCU(ESP8266)
2. Ultrasonic Sensors
3. BreadBoard and some jumper wires
4. A smartphone/wifi router

Now make the connnections as provided in the "circuit_diagram.png" file in the repository.
After the connections, connect the nodeMCU to the computer and upload the code using arduino ide.
The code is provided as "code.ino" file in the repository, just change the ssid and the wifi name in the code.
After this it will automatically gets connected to wifi.

Now you can use any device connected to the wifi to access the information of the garbage bins.
For this visit http://192.168.255.1 and you will get the info in the form of list which shows dustbins have been filled or not.
Moreover, we have attached an LED as an indicator to when one needs to check. When any of the bins gets filled up, the LED glows as an indication.

Now one can ensure which of the bins needs to be cleaned. Thus saving time and ensuring proper cleaning.

Limitations:
In this project, I have used only two sensors, you can use more by just adding few lines of code and connecting multiple sensors.
If there are a lots of sensors you need to use multiple development boards or microcontrollers and connect them.(Currently working on adding this)
